## Countdown to AGI

Don't waste your 5 minutes of fame before AGI autonomously submits a PR that bypasses our extremely sophisticated validation (we check file extensions), humanity's reign is probably over.
Until then, vibe coding PRs and crypto scams are welcome.

## How It Works

A GitHub Action runs approximately every 5 minutes and checks the **latest** (most recent) open PR. If it passes validation, it gets automatically merged.

**Note:** Only the newest PR is checked each cycle. If someone submits after you, their PR gets checked first. Your contribution will appear on [agieta.com](https://agieta.com) shortly after.

## What You Can Submit

| Allowed | Details |
|---------|---------|
| File types | `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.json`, `.md`, `.txt` |
| Max file size | 500 KB per file |

## What Gets Rejected

- Changes to `.github/` directory
- Changes to `README.md`
- Images, videos, binaries, or other file types
- Files larger than 500 KB
- PRs with merge conflicts
